The top level directory is in memory, but the second level pagetable and the page itself might not be in memory. The address that points from the 6th entry of the top level directory to the second level pagetable might not be in memory. The operating system knows if it needs to retrieve it from memory or not based on the present-bit. This is typically the last bit of the address inside the entry, so if the last bit of the address inside the 6th entry is 0, that means it is not in memory and need to be fetched from disk. If it is 1 it means that the second level pagetable is in memory, and therefore it does not need to retrieve it. This is the same for the entries in the second level pagetable, the last bit inside the 4th entry here is also a present-bit. If it is 1, the page is in memory, if not, it need to be retrieved from disk.
