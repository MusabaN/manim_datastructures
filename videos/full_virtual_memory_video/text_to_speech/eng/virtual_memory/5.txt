Here we can see that the last bit in the 6th entry of the top directory is a zero, and for visibility colored red. The last bit of the address in an entry in a page directory or pagetable is called the present-bit. When this bit is a 1, it means whatever the address points to, is in memory. When the present-bit is 0, it means that the address it points to is not in memory, and the process reaches a pagefault. A pagefault traps to the kernel, so that the kernel can run the code for the pagefault handler, which can bring what is not present into memory. This means there will be a context switch, from the process who got the pagefault, to the kernel, and then back again once what was not present has now been made present by the operating system. Now we can see <bookmark mark='TURN_GREEN'/> the presentbit become a 1, and it has turned green. So the address it points to is now in memory, which in this case is the second level pagetable.
