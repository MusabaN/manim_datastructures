Now that we have found the second level pagetable, we can continue to find which entry in the second level page table we should now use. As we can see from the next <bookmark mark='POPUP_SECOND'/>three digits those are 011, which represent the decimal number 3, so we should then offset by three, <bookmark mark='BRACE_AND_ARROW'/>and then get the 4th entry in the second level pagetable.
