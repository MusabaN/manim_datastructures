Again, we can see the address to the page has the present-bit set to 0, which means it is not in memory. Again the process will trap to the kernel, which means there will be a context switch from the running process to the kernel, the kernel will then run the code for the pagefault handler, which will bring the page that was not in memory into memory. After that is done, we can now see <bookmark mark='TURN_GREEN'/> that the present-bit changes to a 1 and becomes green. The coloring here is just for visibility.
