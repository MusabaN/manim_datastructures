As we have seen earlier, the PCB contains values that are 
associated with each process. Among other things, the PCB 
holds a value that specifies the top-level directory for 
the top-level page table.

<bookmark mark='A'/> For simplicity, I have chosen to call 
this value PDIR.
In reality, the PCB points to another data structure that 
contains information about the process's memory, where you 
can again find this value, but that is beyond the scope of 
this course.
