Here we can see the CPU illustrated, it actually has many 
more registers than we show here.

<bookmark mark='A'/> Among the registers, there is a register 
called CR3.

This register is used when looking up virtual memory addresses, 
as it points to the top-level page table, or pagedirectory as 
it is called. So when doing a context switch from one process 
to another, this is also one of the values that is loaded into 
the CPU's register.

<bookmark mark='B'/> So here we see that we load the value 
from PDIR in the PCB to the CR3 register on the CPU.
